    <h2>Types of Images Used in Sites</h2>

    <p><u><strong>JPG Images</strong></u></p>
    <p>This image type is designed to handle large color palettes 
        without increasing the file size, which is good for photos that have a lot of 
        gradient in them. JPG's, however, don't allow transparency so an image 
        with no background will have the generic white background.</p>

    <p><u><strong>GIF Images</strong></u></p>
    <p>This image type is typically used for animations, but their color palette is limited.  
        If the image file has detailed areas that are semi-opaque, then the GIF image file 
        is not recommended.</p>

    <p><u><strong>PNG Images</strong></u></p>
    <p>This image type is recommended for images that are not photos or animations
        as they can produce higher quality images. They can also save images 
        that have no backgrounds, so it is great for digital art.</p>

    <p><u><strong>SVG Image</strong></u></p>
    <p>This image type can be scaled up if the images were originally smaller. 
        Using this type is recommended to use than PNG images.</p>
